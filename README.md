# TORNADOES-JIN-WANG
Final Project

This project talks about information of the tornadoes in different years. And the circles
on the map are different tornadoes and the colors of them shows their Fujita Rating.When
users move mouse on the circles, they can see more detail information for this tornado.
One bar on the left shows how many tornadoes happened in a certain day. And the other one
shows how many tornadoes happened in certain state. For this part, there is a interaction
between the bars and the circles on the map. When users move mouse over on circle, they
can also see how many tornadoes happened in its day and how many tornadoes happened in
its states.

However, I am so sorry that I pay more attention on the coding part and I need to
make excels by myself, so the data is not enough, I just type some of them.

Thank you!!

the code is wrote on script-0
go to 1 then go to script then go to script-0
